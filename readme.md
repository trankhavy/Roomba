**Files**

 - classes.py: Includes all the classes created for the simulation
 - visualize.py: Code to visualize different strategy and robot path
 - simulation.py: Conduct multiple simulations and gather statistics
 - sample_rw.py: A sample simulation for random walk strategy
 - sample_ga.py: A sample simulation for genetic algorithm
 - sample_gd.py: A sample simulation for greedy algorithm
 - run.sh: A bash script to run all three sample simulation at once
 - requirements.txt: List of dependencies
 - Simulation results: A folder contains results of the simulations run in simulation.py
 - Final Project.pdf: Report of the simulation and interpretation of the results

**To run the simulation**:

 - Step 1: Create virtual environment
 - Step 2: Install all dependencies listed in requirements.txt
 - Step 3: Run the file run.sh to see all three sample simulations. Otherwise, you can manually run through sample_rw.py, sample_ga.py, sample_gd.py for random walk strategy, genetic algorithm and greedy algorithm simulation.
